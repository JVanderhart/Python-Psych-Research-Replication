# Python-Psych-Research-Replication
This project is another learning project I did to increase my familiarity with Python.
I wanted to understand the differnces between R and Python's data science libraries
so I replicated the same research results from my R project, along with more data
analysis specific methods, such as training and testing the model, something you
don't normally do when just testing for statistical significance.
